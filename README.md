# Merge Conflict Resolution
When merging the second branch 'feature2', GitHub showed a merge conflict in `sample.html` because both branches had modified the same `<h1>` tag.

To resolve it, I manually combined the content and styling by keeping the updated text from `feature2` and the styling from `feature1`.

And after this i have commit the changes and resolved the merge conflict
